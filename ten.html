          Lionel Messi leads a group that collectively earned more than $990
          million in 12 months, with the bar for entry higher than ever.

        <span>L</span> ionel Messi was only 17 when he began suiting up for the
        top squad at FC Barcelona, so it was more than a little jarring when,
        after 17 seasons, he left the only professional home he had ever known
        to transfer to Paris Saint-Germain last August

        In one regard, though, this season marked a return to familiar territory
        for the 34-year-old soccer superstar.
        <br />
        <br />
        With $130 million in pre-tax gross earnings over the last 12 months,
        Messi claims the top spot in Forbes’ annual ranking of the world’s
        highest-paid athletes, leading the list for the second time (the other
        was in 2019). Although Forbes estimates that Messi’s salary is down some
        $22 million from his final year with Barcelona—to $75 million this
        season at PSG—a major boost in endorsements helps him equal the record
        12-month total for a soccer player he posted last year, when he finished
        No. 2 to MMA fighter Conor McGregor.
        <br />
        <br />
        Messi’s archrival, Cristiano Ronaldo—who also switched teams in August,
        moving from Juventus to Manchester United—lands at No. 3 this year with
        $115 million. Sandwiched between the two is the Los Angeles Lakers’
        LeBron James with $121.2 million, crushing the $96.5 million record for
        an NBA player that he set last year. James becomes only the tenth
        athlete ever to surpass $100 million in a single year, a milestone Messi
        and Ronaldo have now reached five times each.

          Giannis Antetokounmpo is the only member of this year’s top ten still
          in his 20s. The Milwaukee Bucks’ two-time MVP signed a five-year, $228
          million contract in December 2020, the NBA’s largest contract by total
          value to date. He was among the investors in timepiece resale platform
          WatchBox’s $165 million funding round announced in November, and he
          has also signed a licensing deal with NFT platform NFTSTAR and added
          WhatsApp and Google’s Pixel 6 phone to his endorsement stable. And
          Antetokounmpo will soon be able to watch his life story in the biopic
          Rise, set to be released on Disney+ in June.

          Tom Brady’s retirement this off-season lasted less than six weeks,
          which was welcome news for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after he turned in
          a spectacular 2021 season at age 43. He’s certainly learning some new
          tricks off the field. Autograph, the NFT platform Brady cofounded last
          year, raised $170 million in a Series B funding round announced in
          January, and Religion of Sports, the production company he cofounded
          with Pro Football Hall of Famer Michael Strahan and filmmaker Gotham
          Chopra, unveiled a content deal with Skydance Sports in March.
          Meanwhile, his other production company, 199 Productions, is behind
          the upcoming road-trip movie 80 for Brady, and he has a new clothing
          line cleverly named BRADY. And when it is finally time to retire
          permanently from football, Brady already has his next lucrative gig
          lined up: a commentator role with Fox Sports. According to the New
          York Post, that deal is set to pay him more than he has earned on the
          field across 22 seasons in the NFL—$375 million over ten years.

          Canelo Alvarez is boxing’s top draw, earning $40 million or more from
          his two pay-per-view victories last May and November. (His loss to
          light-heavyweight champion Dmitry Bivol on May 7, 2022, fell outside
          Forbes’ tracking window for this list.) Beyond the ring, Alvarez has a
          lucrative partnership with Hennessy and owns a taco restaurant in his
          native Mexico, with plans to expand to California. Alvarez said last
          year that he would be launching a chain of gas stations, and his
          Canelo Promotions is putting together a series of fights in Mexico in
          partnership with Matchroom Boxing and DAZN.

          Injuries limited Roger Federer to six tournaments in 2020 and 2021
          combined, and he has yet to return to the tennis court in 2022. No
          matter—the world’s former No. 1 player remains the top pitchman in
          sports, promoting brands such as Uniqlo and Rolex. He also invested in
          the burgeoning Swiss shoe brand On in 2019, and the company went
          public in September, raising more than $600 million. “We work very
          closely together on product design,” Federer told Forbes at the time,
          having spent 20 days in the lab with the On team developing the
          company’s pro tennis shoe.

          and investment firm Thirty Five Ventures, his business empire goes far
          beyond endorsements. NFT platform OpenSea and digital fitness startup
          Future are among his latest investments, and he is backing SeatGeek’s
          SPAC merger. Durant and his longtime business partner, Rich Kleiman,
          also announced last year that they would launch a SPAC of their own;
          it is still seeking an acquisition.

          No NBA player made more in salary this season than Stephen Curry, and
          the Golden State Warriors guard is due for a raise after signing a
          four-year, $215 million extension last August. He’ll make roughly $48
          million on the court next season, rising to just under $60 million in
          2025-26. Curry’s new FTX endorsement deal also came with an equity
          stake, and he dived deeper into blockchain in December, releasing a
          collection of NFTs that featured his sneakers and were tied to three
          metaverse platforms. (He pledged to donate the proceeds.) Meanwhile,
          Curry’s production company, Unanimous Media, signed a development deal
          with Comcast NBCUniversal in September.

          in Qatar this fall, which he has said could be his last. Off the

          Bull, and he is the subject of a new Netflix docuseries, Neymar: The

          Like his rival Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo has had a disappointing
          first season with his new team, with Manchester United stuck in sixth
          place in the Premier League standings with one game remaining. Rumors
          are now swirling that Ronaldo, who previously played for Man U from
          2003 to 2009, could be on the move once more in this summer’s transfer
          window. Much of Ronaldo’s earning power comes from his massive social
          media presence: He has 690 million followers across Instagram,
          Facebook and Twitter, giving him leverage to demand sky-high rates
          from sponsors such as Nike, Herbalife and Clear shampoo. He is also an
          investor in Tatel restaurants—including a new location in Beverly
          Hills—and is the face of ZujuGP, a forthcoming app aiming to be a
          ​​digital soccer community.

          LeBron James’ Los Angeles Lakers missed the playoffs this season, but
          he’s never been so dominant off the court. He starred in last year’s

          from HBO to YouTube. In October, he sold a significant minority stake
          in SpringHill—the production company behind both projects—at a
          valuation of about $725 million, pushing his net worth to $850
          million, according to Forbes’ estimates. After announcing an
          endorsement deal with Crypto.com in January, James appeared in a Super
          Bowl commercial next to a computer-generated version of his younger
          self. He also recently invested in home gym company Tonal and
          StatusPRO, a sports tech startup that creates virtual reality training
          products.

          Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo with his off-field earnings for
          the first time since 2013. Messi won the Ballon d’Or in 2021 as the
          world’s best men’s soccer player, but he has had a tougher time on the
          pitch more recently, scoring just nine goals in 32 appearances for
          Paris Saint-Germain after notching 38 in 47 games in his final season
          for Barcelona. But while PSG flamed out in the Champions League’s
          Round of 16, the club captured the French Ligue 1 title in Messi’s
          first season.
